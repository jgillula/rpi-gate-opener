## Open Your Gate From Anywhere!
This little gadget allows you to connect a [300 MHz, 10 dip-switch remote gate opener](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GDW3U/) to a Raspberry Pi so that you can open a gate with just a few lines of code.

It connects directly to an off-the-shelf gate opener remote (sold separately) and uses a 5V relay for triggering the gate opener and a voltage conversion circuit for powering the gate opener (replacing the gate opener's battery). It requires only 5V power, ground, and a single GPIO pin from your Raspberry Pi.

## How Do I Use It?
It's simple! Just follow [the instructions in my tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/jeremy-gillula/raspberry-pi-wireless-gate-opener-734460) to finish assembly of your controller circuit.

## Can I just buy one from you?
Yes! You can [buy this kit at different levels of assembly from me on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/flyingsaucrdude/raspberry-pi-gate-opener-adapter/).
